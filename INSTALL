These are preliminary instructions, until we get the config more polished.

To build Quassel IRC, cd to build/ and run qmake && make. This builds all three
versions of Quassel. You may choose individual targets by setting qmakes BUILD
variable:

qmake BUILD=<foo>

where <foo> is any combination of qtclient, core, mono or all. Note that in order
to change this later, you will have to make distclean, otherwise the BUILD setting
seems to be ignored by qmake.

After running make, you will find the binaries in build/targets.

NOTE: As of now, quassel needs the directory $HOME/.quassel to exist prior to first
      run, otherwise it cannot create its database! This will be changed soon, but
      for now, you will just need to create this directory.

The core-side database will be created automatically. A user named 'Default' with
the password 'password' will be created, so in order to connect to the core, you
need to enter this information. The core listens on port 4242 for incoming connections.

Please also do read the README file.

Thanks,
