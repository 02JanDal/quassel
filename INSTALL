Quassel IRC - Installation Notes
================================

These are preliminary instructions, until we get the config more
polished.

Quassel IRC provides three binaries: quasselcore, quasselclient, and
quassel. While quasselcore and quasselclient obviously provide the
separated core and client functionality, the latter one (quassel) is a
monolithic version containing both of them for convenience.

To build Quassel IRC, cd to build/ and run qmake && make. This
builds all three versions of Quassel. You may choose individual
targets by setting qmakes BUILD variable:

qmake BUILD=<foo>

where <foo> is any combination of qtclient, core, mono or all. Note
that in order to change this later, you will have to make distclean,
otherwise the BUILD setting seems to be ignored by qmake.

After running make, you will find the binaries in build/targets.

make install will probably do something, but it has never been tried
and may destroy your system or kill a kitten. It's not necessary
anyway, since there are no installable files other than the
binaries. Though this might change in later releases.

On first run of the Quassel core, it will wait for a client to connect
and present a wizard that will allow you to create the database and one
admin user for the core-side storage. Note that Quassel does not support
the administration of user accounts yet, this includes adding more users,
changing passwords and so on.

Please also do read the README file.

Thanks,
