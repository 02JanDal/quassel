Quassel IRC - Release Notes
===========================

This is a pre-release version. This means that a lot of stuff is not working
yet, that copyright notices and licensing information are not always correct,
and that stuff generelly breaks. We kindly ask you that you don't give out the
source code or svn account information before the first public release. If you
know interested persons, please point them to us and we will gladly make the
source code available to them.

Please don't hesitate to inform us about bugs you encounter (but you probably
don't need to report obviously missing features such as a working topic bar
or nicklist, we know that ourselves ;-)).

The Quassel IRC Team can be contacted on Freenode/#quassel (or #quassel.de).
We always welcome new users in our channels!

The bugtracker can be found at <http://bugs.quassel-irc.org>.
The dev team can be reached by email: devel@quassel-irc.org

Thanks,
~ The Quassel IRC Team
