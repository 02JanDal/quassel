Quassel IRC - Release Notes
===========================

This is a beta version. Although Quassel should be quite usable by now,
there are still many features missing. We are working on adding these;
you might add your wishes and feature requests to our bugtracker though.
Since we are now working on stabilizing the 0.2 branch, bugreports are
more than welcome.
Please also refer to <http://quassel-irc.org/faq> for current issues.

On first run of the Quassel core, it will wait for a client to connect
and present a first-run wizard that will allow you to create the database
and one admin user for the core-side storage.  Note that Quassel does not
support the administration of user accounts yet, this includes adding
more users, changing passwords and so on.

The Quassel IRC Team can be contacted on Freenode/#quassel (or 
#quassel.de).  We always welcome new users in our channels!

Our homepage is <http://quassel-irc.org>
The bugtracker can be found at <http://bugs.quassel-irc.org>
The dev team can be reached by email: <devel@quassel-irc.org>

Thanks for reading,
