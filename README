Quassel IRC - Release Notes
===========================

This is a pre-release version. This means that a lot of stuff is not working
yet, that copyright notices and licensing information are not always correct,
and that stuff generelly breaks. We kindly ask you that you don't give out the
source code or svn account information before the first public release. If you
know interested persons, please point them to us and we will gladly make the
source code available to them.

Please don't hesitate to inform us about bugs you encounter (but you probably
don't need to report obviously missing features such as a working topic bar
or nicklist, we know that ourselves ;-)

On first run of the Quassel core, it will wait for a client to connect and present a
(preliminary) first-run wizard. This will allow you to create the database and one
admin user for the core-side storage. Note that Quassel does not support the
administration of user accounts yet, this includes adding more users, changing passwords
and so on. This is high on our TODO list, of course.

The Quassel IRC Team can be contacted on Freenode/#quassel (or #quassel.de).
We always welcome new users in our channels!

The dev team can be reached by email: <devel@quassel-irc.org>

Thanks,
