Preliminary roadmap for Quassel IRC - stuff we need to do before the first public release

Already Done:
=============
      chatwidget state
      make signalproxy threadsafe
      utf-8 / encodings
      externalize SQL-queries, provide migration path...
      Buffermodel

Showstoppers:
=============
WiP:  settings dialog -> Sput
      serverlist, identities... -> Sput
      mode changes in serverhandler -> EgS
      make wizard more intuitive (account data, two-step auth) -> Sput

Open: network settings in DB -> ?
      switch to network-IDs (depends on network settings into db) -> ?
      remove buffergroups (DB) -> ?
      insert buffertype field rein (DB) -> ?
      core-user admin, rights management (ACL) -> Sput?

BUG:  multi-user join (should be done while switching to network-IDs) -> ?

Important:
==========
WiP:  shortcuts -> Sput

Open: save activity-state in core (client reconnect) -- save per-buffer timestamp locally in client  -> ?
      backlog administration -> ?
      fix Activity and get rid of QtGui dep in client
